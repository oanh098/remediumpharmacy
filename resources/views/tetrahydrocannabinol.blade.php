                                <p>Remedium Bio-Technology have been for some time one of the leading laboratories in Canada in establishing medical uses for THC to the benefit of patients suffering
                                    from numerous conditions worldwide.
                                    <br>Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly referred to as "THC", is a neutral cannabinoid, well known for being strongly psychoactive. Of all our scientific discoveries
                                    that we have contributed to about THC, probably the single most important was how THC enabled scientists to discover the existence of the endocannabinoid system in
                                    vertebrate animals, including humans. A critical part of physiology that, up until then, was unknown and that is now being used to further benefit the medical uses of
                                    THC and with it that of patients.
                                    <br>THC is proven to be effective in treating Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, (PTSD), as well as functioning as an appetite stimulant for HIV/AIDS patients and individuals
                                    suffering from Anorexia. Its benefits also reduces nausea and vomiting from cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and helps patients with insomnia,
                                    inflammation, muscle and joint pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                                <p>THC has now recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of variety of other ailments and disorders including ADHD and our continued research in to its medical
                                    benefits are ongoing.
                                    <br>Similar to Cannabinoids, our medical THC can be administered through variety of methods, including capsules, lozenges, tinctures, dermal patches, oral or dermal sprays,
                                    cannabis edibles, and vaporizing or smoking dried buds.
                                    <br>Our clinical research in to the many ways possible to effectively administer THC, and the flexibility this offers the patient, has been of enormous benefit to the
                                    medical profession in ensuring patients receive the best remedies to their symptoms possible.
                                    <br>The THC clinical research and trials that we perform are ongoing and we are constantly finding more and more medicinal benefits for this sometimes misunderstood medicine.
