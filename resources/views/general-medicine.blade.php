                                <p>The research, development and clinical trials that we undertake at Remedium Bio-Technology are helping doctors, physicians and their patients worldwide,
                                    better manage their many medical conditions and their specific related suffering.
                                    <br>Despite our success with this, we will always continue to focus our research and development for other disease areas that currently have significant unmet needs,
                                    and always with an improved quality of life for patients in mind. We will always seek solutions for a range of diseases that currently have few, or no treatments,
                                    including cystic fibrosis, endometriosis, uterine fibroids and diabetic nephropathy.
                                    <br>Endometriosis is a painful disorder of the uterus that affects an estimated 176 million premenopausal women worldwide. We are working to help patients medically
                                    manage endometriosis and its often debilitating pain. As of February 2018, we have conducted one of the largest clinical trials in Canada to date, and continue to pursue a
                                    new treatment for the disease's most common symptoms.

                                <p>Uterine fibroids are noncancerous muscle tissue tumors of the uterus. Fibroids are most common in women aged 30-40 years and associated with a number of painful symptoms.
                                    For women suffering from heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, there are limited non-surgical treatments. We have several ongoing clinical studies
                                    evaluating the effcacy of a new treatment that helps manage the symptoms of uterine fibroids.

                                    <br>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-threatening, genetic disease that affects between 70,000 and 100,000 patients worldwide. In the US and UK, average life expectancy
                                    is 35 to 40 years old. In countries such as El Salvador, India and Bulgaria, life expectancy drops to below IS. There currently is no cure for CF. We are currently evaluating
                                    investigational compounds in early clinical phases for a triple combination therapy.
                                    <br>Diabetic nephropathy, or diabetic kidney disease, is a common complication of diabetes and the leading cause of chronic kidney disease the developing world.
                                    We are currently conducting a clinical study to assess the effects of an investigational drug on progression of kidney disease in patients with state 2 to 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes.
