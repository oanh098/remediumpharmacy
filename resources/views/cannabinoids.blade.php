                                <p>Our clinical research and development program in to the use of Cannabinoids for use in medicine is now firmly established and accepted being 'cutting-edge' and
                                    we have successfully pioneered their use for the treatment of several diseases and with the managing of disease symptoms.
                                    <br>Cannabinoids are chemical compounds which activate the cannabinoid receptors found throughout our bodies. Phytocannabinoids are the natural forms of these chemicals
                                    found in highest concentrations within female cannabis flowers - more specifically, within the resin glands on the surface of the flower. There are at least 85 different
                                    cannabinoids identified and isolated from various cannabis strains.
                                    <br>Our research has determined that each of these have a unique influence on the body's endocannabinoid system and it is this research and subsequent clinical development
                                    that now allows for thousands of doctors worldwide to allow their patients to manage their symptoms in a better way than before.

                                <p>Medical conditions and symptoms that are already benefitting from our research includes the reduction of nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy,
                                    improved appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, and reduced chronic pain and muscle spasms, to name just a few.
                                    <br>Our medical Cannabinoids can be administered through a variety of methods, including capsules, lozenges, tinctures, dermal patches, oral oral or dermal sprays,
                                    cannabis edibles, and vaporizing or smoking dried buds. Sometimes the condition determines the best way to administer the Cannabinoids, sometimes it is down to the patient's
                                    personal preference. Our research has established the best method in achieving the most benefit to the patient, which is of primary importance to us.
                                    <br>Despite this success, we our still researching and establishing even more usage applications and symptom benefits for patients.
