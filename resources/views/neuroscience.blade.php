                                <p>At Remedium Bio-Technology we are constantly discovering compoun that have the potential to treat chronic disabling neurological conditions.
                                    <br>These conditions and ailments include MS, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's. We are also advancing research across several neurodegenerative disorders,
                                    including multiple sclerosis.
                                    <br>We will undergo research to gain a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying
                                    neurodegenerative diseases. Our goal is to identify novel therapeutic approaches for bringing relief to patients living with these chronic, debilitating diseases.
                                    <br>As the number of patients and caregivers seeking help from the health care system increases, Alzheimer's represents a growing challenge for society. Current treatments simply
                                    address the symptoms and do nothing to prevent the progression of the disease or reverse the damage.
                                    <br>Remedium Bio-Technology is collaborating with some of the world's leading Alzheimer's researchers to identibr ways of stopping the disease in its earliest stages.
                                    Our anti-tau antibody is currently being investigated to treat Alzheimer's disease and progressive supra-nuclear palsy, (PSP), and currently advancing to phase 2 development.

                                <p>Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a progressive chronic disorder of the nervous system that is most often seen in patients between the ages of 20 and 40. In MS, the immune system
                                    attacks a protein called myelin, which forms a protective sheet around neuro-fibers. When myelin is damaged by MS, neurons struggle to communicate, leading to an accumulation
                                    of neuronal loss, atrophy and significant disability over time.
                                    <br>We are committed to meeting the needs of patients with MS, and we are currently supporting treatment options that promote nerve protection and facilitate neuronal regeneration.
                                    <br>>Parkinson's disease is the second most-common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting more than 10 million people worldwide. In addition to our available treatments for advanced
                                    Parkinson's, we are currently exploring other pathways that could provide patients with a new method of treatment for this progressive chronic disease.
                                    <br>We are also developing a new delivery system to enhance the patient and caregiver experience while administering our existing therapy for Parkinson's disease.
