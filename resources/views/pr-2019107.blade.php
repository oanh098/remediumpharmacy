                                    <p>Date Posted: October 7th, 2019 </p>
                                    <p>Remedium Bio Technology have announced the imminent launch of their Rem-Gel medicinal marijuana capsules further to the company’s recently acquired sales license from Health Canada. The Company intends to commence production in first quarter of 2020 and the first shipments are expected to be made shortly after. Remedium Bio Technology also plans to explore exports to international markets by the second or third quarter.
                                    </p><p> Once full-scale production has been achieved the company anticipates it will have capacity to produce over 1 million Rem-Gel capsules per week. Remedium Bio Technology intends to make this high-volume, high-margin, smoke-free, product available to all of its domestic and international target markets over time where legally possible.
                                    </p><p> Remedium Bio Technology's Rem-Gel capsules are produced to pharmaceutical-grade standards in collaboration with leading a leading medicinal gel tablet manufacturer. The company will initially launch the capsules to the medical marijuana market in Canada and will explore the possibility of capsules for the adult-use market later in the year.
                                    </p><p> The company will initially launch two Rem-Gel product types with each capsule being color-coded to distinguish between the different product for the protection of public health and safety and are believed to the smallest cannabis capsules on the market. Remedium Bio Technology's Rem-Gel capsules provide a dosage-controlled format that medical practitioners and consumers around the world need to facilitate more precise administration.
                                    </p><p> Additional product types and potencies will be made available in the coming months including Rem-Gel capsules that contain both THC and CBD for specific treatments such as PTSD and epilepsy, also Rem-Gel capsules that employ a range of functional carrier oils.
                                    </p><p> “Rem-Gels are a high-volume, high-margin product for both the medical and adult-use markets that are in strong demand, and Remedium Bio-Technology is one of few companies making these products available to patients and consumers alike,” said Simon Fullerton, Ph.D., Director of Formulation Sciences at Remedium Bio-Technology.
                                    </p><p> “There is a strong momentum towards smoke-free, consistent dosage delivery technologies, and our Rem-Gels are a very familiar form factor that satisfy patient and consumer needs. We are delighted to have several preferred partnerships in place with several specialist manufacturers whose technology is performing above our initial expectations, delivering high volumes of pharma-grade products,” Fullerton added.
                                    </p><p> Daniel Priestley, Ph.D., Vice President, Product Development at Remedium Bio-Technology added, “Following our successful receipt of our sales license for Rem-Gels we are now ready to start providing yet another type of delivery technology for our patients and customers. Production will be scaling up in the coming months, which will enable us to introduce this product to all our domestic and international target markets. We will also continue to develop new types of Rem-Gel products, broadening our offering to meet all medical and consumer needs.”
