                                <p>At Remedium Bio-Technology we have created special partnerships to help address the needs of people living with HIV and Hepatitis C. We strive to break new ground in
                                    comprehensive care and symptom relief for patients living with the HIV and hepatitis C viruses.
                                    <br>The hepatitis C virus, (HCV), was once a hard to treat, chronic disease, but the availability of new treatments such as direct-acting antivirals, (DAAs), which can
                                    virologically combat the disease in specific genotypes, are impacting the way we have developed and improved care for chronic HCV patients.
                                    <br>It is estimated that over 70 million people are infected with HCV worldwide. The reported incidence of new infections is estimated at nearly 24 cases
                                    per 100,000 people annually.
                                    <br>Since the disease often has no symptoms, the actual incidence may be much higher which is why we have dedicated the amount of research and development to our virology
                                    program as we have in order to benefit those suffering with the virus
                                </p></div>

                            <div class="html_content fade-inL">
                                <p>These special partnerships, along with our own in-depth research, have also assisted with the clinical research that is now benefitting thousands of patients
                                    suffering with the HIV virus. Our determination to assist with the symptoms and patient suffering that HIV causes is benefitting many sufferers worldwide.
                                    <br>The primary benefits include increased appetite, alleviation of nausea, a reduction in anxiety and stress as well as relief of chronic pain.
                                    <br>These benefits that HIV sufferers enjoy are also being enjoyed by other patients that are not suffering from the HIV virus, such as patients with Anorexia, anxiety,
                                    including PTSD, and other mental health issues and arthritis too. Clinical research also now suggests that medical marijuana may cut down seizures in people with epilepsy,
                                    adding yet another reason why Remedium Bio-Technology will continue their IDRT program.
                                    <br>Our research, and that of our partners, will not stop here as we will continually strive to find better cures and more remedies to virological conditions.
