                                    As one of the first analytical laboratories dedicated to the research of medical cannabis in Canada, we've led the science of clinical cannabis since 2007.
                                    During that time, Remedium Bio-Technology has made market changing discoveries, such as High-CBD genetic markers, and pioneered the implementation of self-regulation throughout
                                    the medical cannabis industry.
                                    <br>Today, we employ sophisticated technology and rigorous science to solve problems: whether you're cultivating, processing, or dispensing â€” our CBD and THC research will help
                                    you diagnose, solve, or avoid costly errors in your work flow. <br>
                                    By investing in groundbreaking research, technologies and medical platforms, we aim to drive innovation within our pipeline and deliver better solutions to the medical profession
                                    and their patients. <br>
                                    We are currently exploring several new methods for delivering marajuana infused medicines in a more precise and impactful manner. Whether it be a way to reduce the effect of
                                    chemotherapy on healthy cells, to opening new avenues for treating neurodegenerative diseases, our research and clinical innovation will soon change the way diseases are treated.
                                    <br>At Remedium Bio-Technology, we're driven by a deep affection for scientific exploration and research. Our lab doesn't simply quantify cannabinoid and tetrahydrocannabinol profiles,
                                    or assess the sex of living plants, we also discover new truths in the realms and possibilities of marijuana research and treatments.
