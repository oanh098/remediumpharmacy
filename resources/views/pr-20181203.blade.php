                                    <h2>Remedium Bio Technology Now Well Positioned To Capitalize On North and South America Medical Marijuana Markets </h2>
                                    <p>Date Posted: August 3rd, 2018 </p>
                                    <p>The global marijuana industry has been gaimng significant traction and investors are becoming more bullish on the growth prospects going forward. During the last year,
                                        many companies that have capitalizing on emerging marijuana markets and have been expanding their presence.</p>
                                    <p>One company that meets this criterion is Remedium Bio-Technology which has attractive leverage to North and South America. Although the company's primary focus is based on
                                        the clinical research development of medicinal marijuana the company recently made a significant acquisition in Colombia. </p>
                                    <p>Demand for medicinal marijuana products in South and Central America have been increasing as new markets come on-line and existing markets gain traction. Remedium Bio-Technology
                                        has been laser focused on this opportunity and in early November, the company signed a binding letter of intent to acquire a Colombian-based marijuana company that has been
                                        licensed and operational in Colombia since October 2017. </p>
                                     <p>Remedium Bio-Technology now has access to over 1,000 acres of outdoor cultivation land and is aggressively exploring opportunities to expand. The company's cultivation program
                                         is based on a decentralized model with partner farmers throughout the countny, allowing small farmers to quickly generate high quality crops. </p>
                                     <p>Remedium Bio-Technology also has a partnership with the largest university in Colombia, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, to develop seed strains that improve the yield of
                                         biomass and flower while shortening crop cycles. It has also partnered with Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos√© de Caldas, which focuses on the educational aspects of
                                         marijuana cultivation. The university provides distance education as well as in-class instruction to educate farmers on marijuana crops, ensuring they are able to produce
                                         high quality crops. </p>
                                     <p>"This is a significant development and we are bullish on the growth prospects of this region. The economics associated with cultivating marijuana Colombia are very attractive
                                         and we are favorable on the leverage to this opportunity and we will acquire an asset in a country that is developing its marijuana industry for distribution around the worw
                                         said Daniel Priestley, Ph.D., Vice President, Product Development at Remedium Bio-Technology. </p>
                                     <p>"The leverage to Colombia will make it easier for us to expand further into Latin American and we will monitor how the distribution channels develop first before acquiring
                                         further strategically placed opportunities," Priestley added. </p>
                                     <p>Remedium Bio-Technology has been laser focused on this execution and on the associated growth prospects heading into 2019. The company is in middle of a major expansion and we
                                         will continue to monitor how the team executes their expansion program. </p>
